# Neverwinter Nights - EPiC Arena

Inspired by the popular mid-2000s Bioware's title "Neverwinter Nights", I decided to recreate a much simpler version of this D&D Title.

This is Neverwinter Nights - EPiC Arena. A simple demo, written in Java. 

A co-op turn based game!
Relive 2% of the magical D&D experience we all know and love - all packed in a .jar file!


- 4 player co-op experience

- 5 D&D Classes to choose from

- Random Monsters waiting to ambush you!
